## Name search

Visit [https://www.namebase.io/domains](https://www.namebase.io/domains) and use the Power search to find names you want to own. There are 6 possible results to your name search:

### Owned — listed for sale

This name was already minted. The name is owned by someone else and it's up for sale — you can immediately purchase it. If the seller has enabled "Make an Offer", you'll also be able to make them an offer for their name.

### Owned — unlisted

This name was already minted. The name is owned by someone else and it isn't up for sale. If the owner has enabled "Make an Offer", you'll be able to make them an offer on their name.
