# Create Handshake websites

One of the most straightforward use cases of Handshake names is to set up a website on them. You can also [use Handshake names in these other ways](how-to-use-handshake-names.md).

## Level 1 - No code

### HNSHosting

HNSHosting offers WordPress hosting on Handshake names deployed in minutes with HTTPS support.  
Registering for free might be limited to users on their discord server.

### dLinks

[dLinks](https://namebase.io/dlinks) is a no-code way to instantly deploy a decentralized website to your Handshake name. See our dLink at [namebase/](https://namebase.hns.to).  
dLinks is powered by [Skynet](https://siasky.net/) which is a experimental decentralized CDN so it is likely to be slow and unreliable.
